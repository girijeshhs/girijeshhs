### Hey there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I’m **Girijesh**, a developer from India who likes building things that feel clean, fast, and purposeful.

If something catches my interest, I usually end up turning it into a project — whether it’s AI, web dev, or something experimental.  
If an idea feels worth exploring, I’ll build it, refine it, and ship it.

My main setup leans toward **React, Node.js, Python**, and whatever tools help me move from idea → prototype → working build without friction.

I’ve got a bunch of pinned projects, and each one taught me something different about how to design, think, or build better.

I haven’t hit 100 public repos yet — but the private experiments? …yeah, that number’s growing fast.

If you’re curious about how I build or think through projects, feel free to explore what's here.

#### Fun Facts:

- I like working on things that actually **teach me something** — if it doesn’t push me, I lose interest.  
- I’m **practical with my workflow**: try fast, iterate fast, keep what works.  
- I’m always curious about how things work **under the hood** — that “why does this happen?” instinct never shuts off.  
- **Hobbies:** gym, tech experiments, and anything that keeps life balanced.
